Installation Steps:
Installed melodic from ros.org

Steps to create workspace:
1. Created a folder catkin_ws
2. Created a folder src within catkin_ws
3. ran catkin_init_workspace in the src folder
4. ran catkin_make in the catkin_ws folder which ended up creating two more folders build and devel
5. made a new file named .gitignore and added devel and build in it using touch and gedit respectively.
